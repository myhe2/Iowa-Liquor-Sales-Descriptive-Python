# Iowa-Liquor-Sales-Descriptive-Python
The main purpose of this project is to give an insight on Iowa's alcohol market to the Retaile: Sales and Marketing Manager &amp; Alcohol Companies: Marketing and Public Relations Managers. To provide this in-depth analysis we will be examining the 2019 Iowa Liquor Sales provided by the Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division [1] and 2019 Census-Iowa: Income, Race &amp; Population Dataset [2-4]. Our goal is to explore the following questions: 

1. How are sales or brands impacted when investigating the relationship between the 3 main attributes of the external datasets: Income, Race, and Population?  

2. For 2019, what were the highlights: top 5 popular brands of alcohol as a seasonal decision maker for, total sales based on counties and, total consumed alcohol- based on counties?  

3. What are the main predicting factors of sales that will benefit both sides?

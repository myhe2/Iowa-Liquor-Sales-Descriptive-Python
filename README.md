# Iowa-Liquor-Sales-Descriptive-Python
The main purpose of this project is to give an insight into Iowa's alcohol market to the Retail: Sales and Marketing Manager & Alcohol Companies: Marketing and Public Relations Managers. To provide this in-depth analysis we will be examining the 2019 Iowa Liquor Sales provided by the Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division [1] and 2019 Census-Iowa: Income, Race & Population Dataset [2-4]. Our goal is to explore the following questions:

How are sales or brands impacted when investigating the relationship between the 3 main attributes of the external datasets: Income, Race, and Population?

For 2019, what were the highlights: top 5 popular brands of alcohol as a seasonal decision-maker for, total sales based on counties and, total consumed alcohol-based on counties?

What are the main predicting factors of sales that will benefit both sides?

This project is a collaborative effort of Yashaswini Thokala, Rubina Pradhan, and Nehemie Joseph.
